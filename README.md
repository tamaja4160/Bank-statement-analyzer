## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Tesseract OCR (download from [tesseract-ocr/tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract))
- Windows/Linux/macOS

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tamaja4160/Bank-statement-analyzer.git
cd Bank-statement-analyzer
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Install Tesseract OCR system-wide

## Usage

### For Companies: Generate Synthetic Data for ML Training

#### Generate Images of Realistic-Looking Bank Statements
If you need synthetic data for training OCR models or testing financial software:
```bash
cd bank-statement-generator
python statement_generator.py
# Enter number of statements when prompted (e.g., 10)
```
This creates Excel files and PNG images of authentic German bank statements.

#### Create Hard-to-Read Image Statements
To test your OCR robustness under challenging conditions:
```bash
cd bank-statement-generator
python image_worsener.py
```
This applies rotations, blurs, perspective changes, and other augmentations to create varied image quality for ML benchmarking.

### For Users: Analyze Personal Bank Statements

#### Generate Personal Statements & Analyze Recurring Payments
To automatically track expenses, identify subscriptions, and find ways to save money:
```bash
# Generate test statements
cd bank-statement-generator
python statement_generator.py

# Extract transaction data from images
cd ../simple_image_reader
python simple_image_reader.py ../bank-statement-generator/bank_statements/

# Full analysis with ML recurring payment detection
cd ../streamlit_bank_analyzer
python app.py
```
The ML pipeline will show spending patterns, highlight recurring charges, and suggest opportunities to save money.
