# Bank Statement Suite: Save Time, Money & Boost Revenue

I created a tool that generates bank statements and reads them using OCR, finds recurring payment,s and suggests cheaper alternatives (all based on synthetic data).

## What It Does & How to Use It

You can start immediately with the primary use cases.

### 1\. Create Clean Bank Statement Images

Generate realistic German bank statements (PNG) to test financial software, train OCR, and benchmark ML models.

```bash
# Generate clean, realistic-looking bank statements
cd bank-statement-generator
python statement_generator.py
```

### 2\. Create Hard-to-Read Bank Statement Images

Create challenging statements (blurry, rotated) to test and improve the robustness of your OCR solutions.

```bash
# Create hard-to-read statements to test OCR robustness
cd bank-statement-generator
python image_worsener.py
```

### 3\. Analyze Bank Statements and Save Money

Simulate tracking expenses, identifying subscriptions, and finding ways to save money. Run the entire pipeline from data generation to analysis with a single command and view the results in an interactive dashboard.

Access it under this address: http://localhost:8501/

```bash
# This single command runs the full pipeline and launches the dashboard
python run.py
```
