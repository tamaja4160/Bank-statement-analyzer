- Windows/Linux/macOS

### Setup
```bash
# Clone or navigate to the project directory
cd streamlit_bank_analyzer

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Tesseract OCR (system-dependent)
# Windows: Download from https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
# macOS: brew install tesseract
# Linux: sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
```

## Usage

### Running the Application
```bash
# Correct way to run Streamlit app
streamlit run app.py

# Note: Do NOT run with 'python app.py' as it will cause session state errors
```

### Running the REST API
```bash
# Option 1: Direct execution
python api.py

# Option 2: Using the run script
python run_api.py
```

The API will be available at:
- **API Base URL**: http://localhost:8000
- **Interactive Docs**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:8000/health

### API Endpoints

#### POST `/generate-statements`
Generate bank statements for a user.
```json
{
  "user_name": "John Doe",
  "num_statements": 5
}
```

#### POST `/process-ocr`
Process existing images with OCR.
```json
{
  "user_name": "John Doe"
}
```

#### POST `/analyze-payments`
Analyze recurring payments for a user.
```json
{
  "user_name": "John Doe"
}
```

### Workflow Steps

1. **Enter Your Name**
   - Type your full name in the sidebar
   - Choose number of statements (5-20 recommended)

2. **Generate Statements**
   - Click "üöÄ Generate Statements"
   - Watch real-time progress as statements are created and processed

3. **Review Extractions**
   - View each statement image alongside extracted transactions
   - Check OCR confidence scores
   - Expand transaction details for full information

4. **Analyze Recurring Payments**
   - Click "üìä Analyze Recurring Payments"
   - Review identified recurring billers
   - Get financial insights and analysis

## Output Examples

### Recurring Payment Detection
```
üí° Analysis Insights: Regular billers identified:
